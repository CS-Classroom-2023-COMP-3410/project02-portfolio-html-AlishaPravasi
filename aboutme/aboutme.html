                        <mark>Hi! I'm Alisha Pravasi, an innovative computer science student passionate about creating impactful software solutions.
                        Pursuing a combined B.S./M.S. in Computer Science concentrating in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Denver, 
                        I bring expertise in programming, agile development, problem-solving, object-oriented programming, design, and 
                        team-collaboration, with hands-on experience from four internships and part-time roles at Visa, Outlier, Rocket Lab USA, 
                        and Lavner Education. Skilled in Java, C++, C, Python, SQL, JSON, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Haskell, and more, 
                        Iâ€™m driven to build robust, inclusive technology while championing diversity in tech through leadership in my local 
                        chapters of the National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, Equity in STEM, and 
                        Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority Inc.</mark>

                    <p>
                        <mark>A fun fact about me is that I studied abroad at Korea University in Fall of 2023. There I experienced bounds of personal, interpersonal, and professional growth. With a concentration in Computer Science, I intentionally took classes that taught me about human computer interaction, computer architecture, and accessibility in technology. Innovation and entrepreneurship were also key factors to the curriculum taught at KU. The connections I made with professors and native students alike have changed my outlook as a global citizen and improved my overall work ethic, problem-solving skills, and ability to work in different environments. </mark>
